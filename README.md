### Heyo ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake Sant

I'm Bachelor's of Science in Artifical Intelligence graduate from the University of Malta. I love learning new things no matter what
they are, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in technology.

My dissertation was on Multilingual Low-Resource Translation for Indo-European Languages and in it I leveraged pre-trained Transformer models on translating between languages in a low-resource context (note to self I need to fix the commit issues and upload that code soon).

On my profile you'll have repositories relating to both academic assignments and personal projects. Feel free to check anything out and if you
have any sort of feedback for me, I'd love to hear it!

I'm also an avid music producer, and I have been making instrumental music for the past 5 years or so, as well as being a visual artist, creating my own cover art. Recently I have been minting my visual art as NFTs which can be found at https://opensea.io/collection/elijah-sun-art
