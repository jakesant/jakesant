### Heyo ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake Sant

I'm currently in my third year at the University of Malta, reading for a B.Sc in Artifical Intelligence, whilst also working in IT support. I love learning new things no matter what
they are, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in technology.

On my profile you'll have repositories relating to both academic assignments and personal projects. Feel free to check anything out and if you
have any sort of feedback for me, I'd love to hear it!

I'm also an avid music producer, having been making instrumental music for the past 5 years or so, and a visual artist. Recently I have been minting my visual art as NFTs which can be found at https://opensea.io/collection/elijah-sun-art
