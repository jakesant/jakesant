### Heyo 👋

I'm Jake Sant

I'm currently in my second year at the University of Malta, reading for a B.Sc in Artifical Intelligence. I love learning new things no matter what
they are, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in technology.

On my profile you'll have repositories relating to both academic assignments and personal projects. Feel free to check anything out and if you
have any sort of feedback for me, I'd love to hear it!

I'm also an avid music producer, having been making instrumental music for the past 5 years or so.
